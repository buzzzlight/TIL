# DOM

> Document object model

- Structured representation of HTML documents
- allows javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them
- change text, HTML attributes, and even CSS styles
- HTML과 javascript 연결점

# javascript

- High-level
- Garbage-collected
- Interpreted or just-in-time compiled
- Multi-paradigm
- Prototype-based object-oriented
- First-class function
- Dynamic
- Single-threaded
- Non-blocking event loop

# Scope

## Global Scope

- outside of any function or block
- variable declared in global scope and accessible everywhere

```js
const me = 'Subin';
const job = 'teacher';
const year = 1989;
```

## Function Scope

- variables are accessible only inside function, not outside
- also called local scope

```js
function clacAge(birthYear) {
  const now = 2037;
  const age = now - birthYear;
  return age;
}

console.log(now); // ReferenceError
```

## Block Scope

- variables are accessible only inside block (block scoped)
- however, this only applies to let and const variables
- function are also block scoped (only in strict mode)

```js
if (year >= 1981 && year <= 1996) {
  const milllenial = true;
  const food = 'Avocado toast';
}

console.log(millenial) // ReferenceError
```

## The Scope Chain

- Variable lookup in scope chain
- 부모 범위의 변수들은 자식 블록 안에서 사용할 수 있다
